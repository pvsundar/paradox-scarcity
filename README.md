Replace `yourusername/your-repository-name.git`, `[SUNDAR]`, and `[SUNDAR@UW.EDU]` with your actual GitHub username, repository name, and contact information.

Once you've adjusted the content, you can save it as a `README.md` file in your repository. The `.md` extension indicates that the file is a Markdown file, which GitHub will render as a styled webpage.

You can upload this `README.md` to your GitHub repository along with your app code. If you need help with how to do that, or if you want any specific information added to the README, let me know!
